# Problem 3: How many are we talking?
# You’re an IT manager at a large (and totally made-up) credit-monitoring company,
# Equifacts. Your team reports they detected a breach, in which an unknown number
# of social security numbers have been leaked.
#
# You go to “SocialSecurityNumbersForCheap.com” and download the database of numbers stolen
# from your database. But the data is messy, and there seems to be many duplicates.
#
# I’ve provided the list of social security numbers below:
#
# ss_numbers = [“1234567890”, “4353453390”, “5564435678”, ...]
#
# This list contains duplicates. Find the number of UNIQUE social security numbers
# leaked ASAP so you can send the report to your boss.

# Problem Solving Advice: I strongly recommend that you start with your own SIMPLIFIED and SHORTENED
# list of "social security numbers" for easier debugging. You can run your function on the real
# list I've provided later :)
